    <h2>What are the reasons I joined this Code Nation course?</h2>

    <p>
        I wanted to get back into software development and this was a chance that was offered to me to do just that. 
        So I took the coding course and after I finished was offered the master course. It is my hope that by the end 
        of this course I'll be prepared to get a job in the industry where I can further develop and work on awesome projects
        that will bring me joy and satisfaction. Software development is really the only job I had that I truly enjoyed and 
        I wish to keep doing it.
